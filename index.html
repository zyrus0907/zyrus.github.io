				<span class="space"/><span class="comments">*/</span><br />
				Hey Jas !<br />
				I don't even know how to start.<br />
				But I wanna start by expressing my sincerest apologies for my disrespectful behavior towards you.<br/>
				<span class="comments">//Reflecting on my actions, </span><br />
				I deeply regret the hurt I caused, which led to you distancing yourself from me.<br />
				<span class="comments">// I deeply regret any miscommunication that may have occurred when I asked for nudes. It was never my intention to use you, and I apologize for any misunderstanding it may have caused.</span><br />
				I understand how my behavior may have made you feel the need to create that space between us. <br>
				And it saddens me to see that connection fading.<br />
				<span class="comments">// I yearn for the distance to dissipate because I value our bond immensely.</span><br />
				I want you to feel comfortable, safe, and happy around me.<br />
				I promise to be mindful of your feelings and treat you with the utmost respect and care.<br />
				You promised me that we could start anew<br />
				I long for the things to return the way they were before<br />
				<span class="comments">// when we used to FaceTime every day</span><br />
				<span class="comments">// play games together</span><br />
				<span class="comments">// share laughter</span><br />
				I truly miss those moments, <br />
				and they hold a special place in my heart. <br/>
				<br>
				Also I know that expressed myself in code might be a bit weird or cringe <br/>
				but please understand that I poured a lot of effort and time into creating that animation. <br/>
				I wanted to show you how much I care about you because you mean everything to me. <br/>
	
				<br>
				<br>
				I genuinely hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.<br />
				I want you to know that my feelings for you are real<br />
				I care about you deeply, <br/>
				and I love you a lot a lot a lot <br/>
				I am really grateful and lucky to have you in my life <br/>
	
				<br>
				<br>
				Lastly, <br/>
				I must admit that I despise this distance that has crept between us. <br/>
				and I long for the opportunity to demonstrate in person just how much I care and love you. <br/>
	
				<br>
				<br>
				<span class="comments">// Thank you for taking the time to read this heartfelt apology. I hope we can find a way to reconnect and restore the beautiful bond we once shared.</span><br />
	
				<br>
				<br>
				Now If you want to hug me or forgive me you can touch the heart below<br />
